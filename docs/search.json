This suggests that spawning salmon have difficultly accessing spawning grounds higher in the Frome catchment when there is insufficient water in the river between October and January.\n\n\n\nDiagram showing how the density of redds is predicted to change with distance from the tidal limit under low, medium and high flow conditions.\n\n\nThere are important management implications from Elinor’s study, particularly in light of the forecast increase in frequency and intensity of extreme floods and droughts under climate change and forecast increases in the Dorset human population size. Her findings suggest that we should manage water levels sensitively, particularly between October and January, to ensure that salmon can distribute their redds throughout all of the available spawning habitat, which will give the emerging fry the best chance of survival.\nElinor’s study was very challenging. Among the many difficulties she had to overcome, three were particularly prominent:\n\nShe had the arduous task of collating incomplete and inconsistent datasets into a single manageable database that she could use to test her predictions;\nShe had the near impossible task of deciding how to summarise river discharge data in a way relevant to salmon spawning migrations on the Frome; and\nShe had to devise a statistical analysis to describe salmon redd distributions using only a few simple explanatory variables.\n\nIn completing these tasks, Elinor demonstrated great care, attention to detail, innovative thinking and an ability to critically appraise literature and information.\nHer MSc project will soon be published in the Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\nShe submitted her thesis to the Cardiff University School of Biosciences in September and was awarded a well-earned Distinction – congratulations Elinor!\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{d.gregory2016,\n  author = {Stephen D.

    "title": "Estimating sea trout smolt migration risks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m involved with a project aiming to understand brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) movements in freshwater and estuarine environments.\nHere, I want to share the methods we used to estimate the risks to brown trout when they migrate as sea trout smolts.\nBut first a little background.\n\nBackground\nBrown trout are funny fish.\nSome spend their entire lives in freshwater, e.g., a river, and are known as brown trout. Others migrate to marine waters, e.g., an estuary or sea, and are known as sea trout.\nSea trout return to freshwater a lot larger than brown trout, after feasting on the abundant food available in marine waters, and are able to produce more eggs. Brown trout might be smaller but they don’t run the risk of being eaten by any of the abundant marine predators.\nClearly, there is a fitness trade-off between getting big & producing more eggs (maximise your potential reproduction) and avoiding being eaten by any one of the abundant marine predators (maximise your potential survival to reproduction).\nThe decision to migrate is not, however, black and white. Finnock are brown trout that use estuaries and transitional waters for only short periods, e.g., a couple of months, presumably to feed.\nSo which strategy is best: brown trout, finnock or sea trout?\nTo study this question, we estimated the risk to sea trout of migrating through fresh, transitional and estuarine waters.\nTo estimate these risks, we acoustically tagged a sample of migrating sea trout smolts who’s migration pathways were recorded at listening receivers located in the different zones (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nLocation of listening receivers in Poole Harbour. Red dots represent approximate detection range of the receivers.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis methods\nAcoustic tracking data has the problem that detection is imperfect; we do not always detect a passing tag and so we don’t know if (i) the tag didn’t pass or (ii) whether it passed but was not detected.\nThis problem can and should be addressed statistically.\nTo estimate the risks to sea trout smolt of migrating through different zones, we used Bayesian State Space models (wikipedia: State-space representation).\nI was reassured that others have used BSSMs in this context: Oliviez Gimenez’s paper explains clearly the theory of BSSMs for marked individuals and Chris Holbrook’s paper was an illustrative example of BSSM implementation for acoustically tagged lamprey.\nIn essence, BSSM estimates jointly the probability that a tag is detected at a particular location and the probability that it made the transition to that location successfully.\nIn our study, we assumed that all individuals shared the same detection and transition probabilities, i.e., that physical or behavioural differences between individuals were unimportant, and that individuals travelled independently.\nWe could therefore use the simple Cormack, Jolly & Seber (CJS) model given by:\n\\[\nY_t|X_t \\sim Binomial(X_t − u_t, p_t)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{t+1}|X_t \\sim Binomial(X_t, \\phi_t) + u_{t+1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_t\\) is the total number of survivors from time \\(t\\), which includes \\(u_t\\) that is the number of newly marked individuals at time \\(t\\), \\(Y_t\\) is the total number of previously marked individuals encountered at time \\(t\\), \\(p_t\\) is the probability of detecting a tagged individual at time \\(t\\) (\\(t = 2, ..., T\\)) and \\(\\phi_t\\) is the probability that a tagged individual transitions to time \\(t + 1\\) given that it is alive at time \\(t\\) (\\(t = 1, ..., T − 1\\)).\nThis formulation separates the nuisance parameters (the detection probabilities, \\(p_t\\)) from the parameters of interest (the transition probabilities, \\(\\phi_t\\)) because the latter are found only in the second or “state” equation.\nUsing this model, we estimated values of \\(p_t\\) and \\(\\phi_t\\) using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in JAGS. JAGS uses Gibbs sampling to explore the joint probability distribution of \\(p_t\\) and \\(\\phi_t\\). Through an iterative process, weakly informative \\(Beta(1, 1)\\) prior distributions on \\(p_t\\) and \\(\\phi_t\\) were updated with increasingly credible values until, after sufficient iterations, the best estimated values of \\(p_t\\) and \\(\\phi_t\\) were taken to be the median of their posterior distributions.\nWe ran JAGS from within R using functions from package dclone. We ran three MCMC chains for 30,000 iterations, of which we discarded the first 10,000 as burnin.\nR code to run an example BSSM is as follows:\nThe JAGS model file for the example might be BSSM.jags:\n\n# simulate data\nreceivor_efficiencies <- c('r1' = 0.8, 'r2' = 0.9, 'r3' = 0.6, 'r4' = 0.7, 'r5' = 0.7, 'r6' = 0.7)\nn_fish <- 77\nch_m <- matrix(NA, ncol = length(receivor_efficiencies), nrow = n_fish)\nfor(i in 1:length(receivor_efficiencies)){\n    ch_m[, i] <- sample(c(0, 1), n_fish, TRUE, c((1 -

    "text": "We wrote a chapter for the 2nd International Sea Trout Symposium proceedings.\n\nAbstract\nMigration between freshwater nursery grounds and saltwater feeding areas is a critical event in sea trout life history. During their seaward migration, smolts encounter both natural and man-made obstructions as well as increased exposure to predators. This is particularly true in the transition zone between freshwater and saltwater where smolts enter a new environment, change their behaviour and encounter new predators. Over two years (2013-14), 81 trout smolts were trapped and acoustically tagged 17 km upstream of the tidal limit in the River Frome in Dorset, UK. Smolt migrations were then tracked by acoustic receivers deployed throughout the lower river and its estuary and the detected movements were used to estimate loss rate and migration behaviour. A Bayesian State Space model was applied to separate detection and transition probabilities. More than 90% of the in-river detections occurred at night whereas detections at the saline limit and throughout the estuary were spread evenly between day and night. Median migration speed in the river was 65-70 km day-1 in both years, whereas the migration speed was slower through the estuary with median speeds of less than 10 km day-1. No zone displayed particularly high loss rates (range 0.5-1.1 % km-1), hence there was no pronounced increase in mortality in the transition zone as reported by a number of similar studies from other systems. The cumulative loss of trout smolts through the 33 km section that the smolts were tracked was 24%, demonstrating a significant cost in terms of loss associated with smolt migration.\nThe citation is: Lauridsen, R.B., Moore, A., Gregory, S.D., Beaumont, W.R.C., et al. (2017) Migration behaviour and loss rate of trout smolts in the transitional zone between freshwater and saltwater.

Specifically, we were measuring the distances between salmonid redd locations and juvenile survey locations on the river Frome, Dorset, UK.\nTogether, we devise a generalisable method to calculate the least cost distance between points located on a complex river network.\nOur method includes the following steps:\n\nconvert the river polygon dataset to a high resolution raster;\nthin that high resolution raster to represent the river as a network of single pixel width linear features;\nshift the sample site coordinates to the closest river pixel in the thinned raster; and\ncalculate the least cost distance between a set of coordinates.\n\nOur analysis is quite Frome-specific and so rather than outline the whole procedure Jess and I decided to present a contrived example to illustrate the last and most important step of the analysis: step 4.\nFor the remainder of the steps, we used a combination of R and GRASS GIS\n\nAn example\nWe provide a small example script with reproducible data (see downloads below) to run step 4.\nIt calculates distances along the local roads from the FBA River Laboratory (our address) to the local shop and pub.\n\n\nR script\n\n# start clean\nrm(list = ls())\n\n# start the clock\ntimer <- proc.time()\n\n# libraries\nrequire(rgdal)\nrequire(raster)\nrequire(rasterVis)\nrequire(gdistance)\n\n# read in EastStoke to Wool road network; in your current path\nv <- readOGR('EastStoke_to_Wool_roads.shp', 'EastStoke_to_Wool_roads')\n\n# add \"val\" field as 1 everywhere\nv@data$val <- 1\n\n# get extent\nex <- extent(v)\n\n# make empty raster at 1m resolution\nr <- raster(ex, res = 0.0001, crs = proj4string(v))\n\n# rasterize road network\nrp <- rasterize(v, r, 'val')\n\n# read in stops\nstops <- readOGR('esw.shp')\n\n# find least cost distances for stops\ntr <- transition(rp, function(x) 1 / mean(x), 8)\ntr1 <- geoCorrection(tr)\nsl <- shortestPath(tr1, origin = stops[1, ], goal = stops[-1, ], output = 'SpatialLines')\n\n# prepare plot\n# x11(width = 16, height = 10)\npar(mfrow = c(1, length(sl)))\n\n# plot path loop\nfor(i in 1:length(sl)){\n\n  ## plot raster\n  plot(rp, legend = FALSE)\n  \n  ## add road network\n  plot(v, add = TRUE)\n\n  ## add stops to plot\n  points(stops[c(1, i + 1), ], pch = 16, col = 'red')\n\n  ## add shortest path\n  plot(sl[i], col = 'blue', add = TRUE)\n}\n\n# get path lengths\nl <- SpatialLinesLengths(sl)\nprint(l)\nDownload the data here.\nThe final result is shown on a map at the start of this post.\nYou can check the calculations against those given by Google Maps here\nWe hope this is of interest to someone.

    "text": "What is an ordered factor?\n\n\nWhy might we use them?\n\n\nAnd what are the implications of using ordered factors in statistical analysis?\n\nIf you’d like my views on these questions, then read on…\n\nBackground\n\nWhat is an ordered factor?\n\nAn ordered factor is a categorical variable whose levels have a meaningful order. In the oven knob picture above, there are 4 levels: ‘OFF’, ‘LOW’, ‘MED’ and ‘HIGH’ and these should be ordered as ‘OFF < LOW < MED < HIGH’.\n\nWhy might we use them?\n\nWe often choose to use an ordered factor when it is difficult to put our variable on a meaningful continuous scale, i.e., from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) where all numbers are real, e.g., not an integer or a qualitative representation of a real number, which would be a category.\nSometimes, we choose to use an ordered factor because we don’t have the equipment required to measure a variable on a continuous scale, e.g., river flow might be classified on a ordinal scale of ‘1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5’, which has 5 levels. This is not, however, a continuous variable.\n\nAnd what are the implications of using ordered factors in statistical analysis?\n\nWhen we choose to classify a continuous variable on an ordinal scale, i.e., treat the variable as a ordered factor, then we should be aware of the statistical implications for doing so. In the situation that we have a small sample size, i.e., a small number of cases, then we will likely have only few residual degrees of freedom to assess the ‘statistical significance’ of our statistical model. This is because we can only assess the ‘statistical significance’ of an ordered factor by fitting it as a polynomial term with the degree equal to the number of levels - 1. In our river flow example, the effect of river flow x on our response variable y is assessed by fitting the polynomial contrasts x^1, x^2, x^3 and x^4 (but not x^5 because one level has to be retained as the contrast level, hence the polynomial term has number of levels - 1 degrees).\nIn what follows, I will try to illustrate these points using simulated data in R. I present all the code so that the interested reader can run the analyses for themselves.\n\n\nStatistical analysis of an ordered factor\nLet’s begin by simulating some data for the multiple regression\n\\[y \\sim \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\]\nIn this example, \\(x_1\\) might be water temperature and \\(x_2\\) might be river flow, both recorded on their (theoretically) continuous scale \\(-\\infty < 0 < +\\infty\\). (In actual fact, river flow would be a Gamma variate because it can not be less than zero.)\nOnce we have simulated the data, let us fit the generating model back to the simulated data to show that we have done it correctly, and then plot the partial (or marginal) effects of each explanatory variable (Figure 1).\n# load libraries\nrequire(effects)\n\n# simulate data; generating values\nN <- 1000\na <- 5\nb1 <- 5\nb2 <- 3\nx1 <- rnorm(N)\nx2 <- rnorm(N)\nsigma <- 1\nepsilon <- rnorm(N, 0, sigma)\ny <- a + (b1 * x1) + (b2 * x2) + epsilon\n\n# fit lm()\nlm_fit <- summary(lm(y ~ x1 + x2))\n\n# print coefs; note they are similar to the generating values\nround(lm_fit$coef, 3)\n##             Estimate Std.

When treating the continuous variable as an ordered factor.\n\n\nFrom the partial effect plots, we see that the influence of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) on \\(y\\) are very similar whether \\(x_2\\) is treated as a continuous variable or an ordered factor.\nNote, however, that the statistical model in which \\(x_2\\) is treated as an ordered factor has three additional coefficient estimates, representing the polynomial contrasts \\(x_2^2\\), \\(x_2^3\\) and \\(x_2^4\\).

In other words, it might be “statistically significant” but no-one has any idea what the effect size is!\nMoreover, it changes the coefficient estimates of other estimated parameters, in this case a.\n\n\nMy views\nRecording a continous variable as an ordered factor might seem like an easy solution when faced with limited resources, such as time or money.\nI warn, however, that before taking that decision, consider the following issues carefully:\n\nWhat will be my sample size or number of cases? If the number of cases is low, particularly if the number of cases per explanatory variable is fewer than 5, then one really should quantify the variable on its true continuous scale, irrespective of the resources available.\nIf using an ordinal scale, how does it relate to the continuous scale? Perhaps one can get away with using an ordinal scale if it is very carefully designed to capture the range of values (and therefore effect sizes) of the continuous variable on the response variable.\nCan one use a different variable Perhaps there is a better explanatory variable to use?\nThink carefully!\n\nI hope this is useful to someone.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{d.gregory2017,\n  author = {Stephen D.

Freshw Biol. https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12929\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding the geographical scales at which environmental variables affect an individual’s body size, and thus their mortality risk, can inform management strategies to help conserve wild populations under climate change. Yet, our current understanding of these relationships is based on studies done at different scales that report inconsistent findings. We predicted that temperature-related variables (e.g. winter temperature) influence body size at a “regional” scale, that is, affecting individuals in geographically independent catchments similarly, whereas non-temperature-related variables (e.g. conspecific competitor density) exert a “local” influence, that is, affecting individuals in geographically independent catchments differently.\nWe developed statistical models to test our predictions using body length measures of a large and long-term sample of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from three rivers in the U.K. and France. We developed mixture models to predict the individual juvenile salmon ages objectively from their body length. We then developed linear mixed models to describe inter-annual changes in mean length of the youngest (age 0) cohort of juvenile salmon from river-specific seasonal variables, and tested whether they exerted their influence at a “local” or “regional” scale. All models accounted for spatio-temporal differences in sampling protocols and individual reproductive strategy. We estimated and interpreted coefficients using Bayesian theory.\nOur findings supported our predictions. Juvenile salmon were longer in years of higher overwinter water temperature and this effect was best parameterised as a single “regional” coefficient applicable to all three rivers. Similarly, spring mean temperature was best parameterised with a single “regional” nonlinear coefficient. In contrast, juvenile salmon were shorter in years of high densities of competing conspecifics and their interaction with total mean discharge and these effects were represented by local river-specific coefficients. Summer droughts had a negative effect on juvenile salmon length but was best parameterised as a single “regional” coefficient, contrary to our expectations.\nWe show that environmental variables affect biological processes at different but predictable geographical scales. Temperature-related variables affect body sizes of exothermic animals at a regional scale, whereas non-temperature variables, such as the density of conspecific competitors and water abstraction, exert their influence at a local scale. These findings highlight the importance of integrating local and regional management plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the body size, and ultimately the conservation, of exothermic species.\n\nA pdf reprint is available here: Gregory2017.pdf\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{d.gregory2017,\n  author = {Stephen D.

The effects of flow on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) redd distribution in a UK chalk stream between 1980 and 2015. Ecol Freshw Fish. 2017;00:1–10. https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12330\n\nAbstract\nAtlantic salmon are an ecologically and economically important migratory fish in the UK, whose stocks have been declining over the past 30 years. Future climate and water use changes have the potential to alter the reproductive behaviour and distribution of salmon within a river, by restricting times and ability to access suitable spawning areas. As the survival of emergent salmon juveniles is density dependent, understanding how climate-driven changes in flow affect the location of salmon redds is important for future conservation efforts. This study examined how flow conditions affect the distribution of redds within a UK chalk stream, the river Frome in Dorset. Sixteen years of redd distribution and flow data between 1980 and 2015 were analysed using linear mixed-effects modelling. Generally, highest redd densities occurred within middle reaches of the main river. Mean flow during the river Frome critical migration period (October–December) did not affect the density of redds directly but affected the relationship between redd density and distance from tidal limit: redd densities were spread more uniformly throughout the river under high flow conditions, whereas redds were more aggregated in the middle river reaches under low flow conditions. Together, these findings suggest that access to upstream spawning grounds was limited under low flow conditions, which could have negative repercussions on juvenile survival. This study has revealed the distribution of redds along the river Frome for the first time and provided a basis for further study into the effects of redd distribution on subsequent juvenile life stages.\nA pdf reprint is available here: Parry2018.pdf\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{d.gregory2017,\n  author = {Stephen D.

    "text": "As the rate of climate change accelerates, so too does the rate at which climate-related records are surpassed. The 2015/2016 winter has gone down in history as the second wettest UK winter since records began, beaten only by the 2013/2014 winter. January 2014 was the wettest month in almost 250 years. This followed an appallingly soggy 2012 that was (at the time) the second wettest year on record. Some might seek solace that the wettest year on record was decades ago. Sadly not: the wettest year on record was in 2000.\nTo cut a long story short, four of the UK’s five wettest recorded years have occurred since 2000 (in order of wetness: 2000, 2012, 2008 and 2002).\nIt seems that long-term woodland destruction, urbanisation, loss of lakes and ponds and modifications to natural river channels have literally cleared the way for a torrent of water to cascade unabated into lower river catchments. And this happens so quickly that there isn’t time for drainage systems to cope. Flooding ensues and endures.\nWhilst their effect on human inhabitations is all too obvious, we are not the only species to be affected by floods. Fish inhabit the very rivers that are bursting their banks onto the surrounding towns and countryside. Unlike humans, however, fish have been experiencing floods in their native river habitats for hundreds or thousands of years. And because floods present a strong evolutionarily selective force (you adapt or you die), fish have adapted to survive and even thrive under certain flood conditions.\nSalmonids are a good example of a group of fish species that have adapted to local flow regimes, inhabiting a range of rivers from those in Scotland with highly variable flows and high-gradient channels to shallow and stable slow-flowing chalk stream in southern England.\nUnderstanding how floods affect salmon is complicated by three unavoidable factors:\n\nFloods will affect different salmon life stages, such as eggs and adults, differently\nFloods of different characteristics, such as timing and duration, will affect each life stage differently\nOur ability to study salmon movements and behaviours under flood conditions is impacted by turbid waters and reduced equipment efficiency or malfunction\n\nThe interactions between the first two complexities have not been well studied, perhaps because floods are rare events and studies to understand the effects of flood characteristics on different salmon life stages will suffer from too few observations. Instead, research has tended to examine the influence of a single measure of flow on a specific salmon life stage and its variation.\nA factor that limits the distribution of salmonids is availability of useable spawning gravels. One can imagine that floods are good for salmonids if they allow them to reach otherwise inaccessible spawning grounds. Here, however, the trouble comes if the redds (egg nests) are exposed to environmental stress when the water recedes: the instinct to seek suitable gravels high in the river channel could prove a poor adaptation if the channel then dries in spring, causing the eggs to die – a type of evolutionary trap. However, if the flood duration were sufficient to maintain suitable redd conditions, then these otherwise inaccessible spawning grounds could prove to be highly productive.\nOne of the most sensitive salmonid life stages is the egg. Salmonids lay their eggs in gravels, in part, to protect them from adverse environmental conditions, such as high flows. Under flood conditions, high velocity water can wash eggs out of redds causing them to die. This is particularly true for grayling that lay their eggs shallow in redds. This is also more likely in rivers with hard bedrock that tend to react quickly and fiercely to rainfall events. On the other hand, a comparatively low magnitude or long duration flood could wash sediments out of redds that would otherwise asphyxiate the developing eggs, thereby improving egg survival.\nIf eggs survive the floods, then they emerge as fry. Fry tend to stay in the shallow and protected waters at the edges of river channels to avoid predators and because they are not strong swimmers. High flows during, or shortly after emergence has been associated with high fry mortality – they too can be washed out of the river and die, whether down the river channel into saline water or over the edge of the channel onto adjoining land. However, fry swimming ability increases quickly with size and so the timing of the flood is critical to fry survival.\nSummer floods are perhaps less common and so their effects are even less well understood. One factor thought to affect the growth and development of juvenile salmonids is the number of other juvenile salmonids, through density dependent growth: as the number of juvenile salmon increases, so the area available for each individual to find food and grow decreases. Assuming density dependent growth, then a summer flood that increases the wetted area of the river might convey increased growth rates and better conditioned juveniles with a higher chance of survival. With their improved swimming ability compared to fry, juveniles are less susceptible to washout during floods.\nOnce beyond the juvenile stage, the effect of flow on salmon and sea trout becomes important for migration timing. Flows facilitate the downstream migration of smolts. High flows and associated turbidity could increase the rate at which smolts migrate out of the river in murky water, both of which will help to lessen the risk of predation.\nWhen it comes to re-entering the river as a spawning adult, then flow again appears to be a trigger, although the exact nature of the relationship between flow and migration timing has proven elusive:\n\nIt is not clear whether they move on or after floods (or freshets) or, indeed, whether they are even present in the river mouth at the time of floods\nThere is high inter-river variability; for example, flow might be less influential on chalk streams with more stable flow conditions relative to granite rivers.\n\nOnce in the river, salmon migration occurs in three phases:\n\nThe upstream migration phase\nThe spawning ground searching phase\nThe spawning site holding phase\n\nOf these, phase 1 is the most affected by flow. The speed of upstream migration seems to increase with increasing flow, although in floods the salmon may stop moving and be forced to take refuge. Again, the exact timing of these different phases is likely to be associated with floods or freshets, but the precise nature of that association remains elusive. It seems clear that flooding can affect salmonids in many ways and developing an understanding of the interactions and trade-offs will require the use of high-quality, long-term (or well-replicated) datasets that are difficult to collect in aquatic systems. Fish cannot simply be counted like birds because they can’t be seen without additional apparatus. This is further complicated because water is corrosive, conductive and carries debris and huge energy, particularly during flood conditions.\nAt East Stoke, on the River Frome in Dorset, the GWCT has been monitoring adult, smolt and parr salmon for the last 44, 21 and 16 years, respectively. To do this, we use a range of monitoring equipment, including a resistivity counter, a 24-hour video surveillance camera and a system of electronic tag-reading devices (approximately 10,000 juvenile salmon are marked with electronic tags each year). For the large majority of the time, this equipment does an excellent job of detecting migrating salmon. Rarely, however, when flow conditions are extraordinary, such as under major flood conditions, the efficiency of the equipment is compromised.\nTake the spring and summer floods of 2012 as an example. Daily flows from the end of April to the end of September were unprecedented among records dating back to 1992 (Figure 1). These extraordinary flows forced us to lift our electronic readers on the East Stoke salmon counter (Figures 2) and reduced our resistivity and video counter efficiency. Consequently, we reported a minimum adult salmon count in 2012. Also, because the floods began at the end of April, they impinged on our ability to quantify the migration of smolts from the river, which usually ends in late April or early May.\n\n\n\nDaily flows for 2012 (black line) compared to flows for years 1992 to 2011 (grey lines).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe East Stoke fish counter under normal flow conditions in 2010 and under flood in 2012.\n\n\nDespite sometimes treacherous conditions, there are only three other years when we have reported a minimum adult salmon count. Figure 3 shows that we have recorded three years with extraordinary high median monthly flows (1994, 2000 and 2012). In two of these years – 2000 and 2012 – we reported a minimum adult salmon count. In contrast, we were able to produce an accurate count in 1994, despite the extraordinary flow conditions. This highlights two points:\n\nThat we can produce counts under flood conditions but they might be less accurate\nThere might be times when our counting system malfunctions for reasons other than flow, in which we can produce only a minimum count, such as occurred in 1989 (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots showing monthly flows for each year and highlighting those years for which (1) we were unable to produce an accurate adult salmon count (red box), and (2) the river was in flood (blue fill). The dashed line is the mean monthly flow excluding flood years.\n\n\nWith growing evidence that we’re being propelled ever faster towards the wetter and warmer winters predicted by climate change scientists a decade ago, we’ll have to find ways to cope with flooding and the effects it will have on our salmon and grayling monitoring programmes. We need also, however, to be mindful of the effects on our salmonid populations and our ability to monitor them during drought conditions, which are forecast to become more frequent and intense.\nOne of the ways in which we are attempting to do this is statistically. Within the MorFish project, we designed a statistical framework that allows us to use information from periods when the salmon counting system is operational to predict what the salmon count was likely during periods when the system is malfunctioning. In addition, the analysis uses observations to learn about the system efficiency under variable flow conditions and use that information to improve estimates during periods of low efficiency. Finally, because floods are associated with other environmental factors, e.g., increased turbidity, we aim to extend the framework to investigate whether these additional factors will change our salmon count estimates.\nIt is hoped that these analyses will deliver useful information on the effects of extreme flows (droughts and floods) on the health of salmon – and more generally, fish – population dynamics. What we then do to manage flow regimes are decisions that will need to be made at a local scale, since flow regimes are tied into many local factors, including geology, river-specific hydroecology and hydromorphology and – of course – abstraction regimes. Certainly, the answer will lie in maintaining the ecological integrity of the river. One step to doing this will be to understand and encourage its natural hydrological variability, both seasonally and interannually, an approach known as the “natural flow paradigm”.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{d.gregory2016,\n  author = {Stephen D.

This, however, is only a small part of the popultion: we PIT tag only a fraction of the population of salmon (and trout) juveniles in August and September each year (see the GWCT webpage for more details).\nBut, we are interested in estimating the total salmon smolt population size, i.e., the PIT-tag marked and the unmarked populations combined.\nTo do this, we can divide the estimate of PIT-tag marked salmon smolt population by the proportion of salmon smolts that are PIT-tag marked by\n\\[\\hat{N}_{total} = \\hat{N}_{marked} / Q\\]\n\\[Q = n_{marked} / n_{total}\\]\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the proportion of salmon smolts that are PIT-tag marked and \\(n\\) is a sample of smolts.\nBut how do we get a sample of smolts from which to measure \\(n_{marked}\\) and \\(n_{total}\\)?\nWe use a Rotary Screw Trap (RST) to capture a sample of migrating salmon smolts.\n\n\n\nOur Rotary Screw Trap (RST) on the river Frome, Dorset.\n\n\nRunning the RST is not an easy job.

By checking the RST every 30 minutes, it was hoped that we would minimise our effect on migrating smolts, returning them back to the river no more than 1 hour after they first entered the RST, i.e., night-time migrating smolts could continue their migration under the cover of night and vice versa.\nOver the course of the smolt migration, we capture \\(n_{total}\\) smolts and record \\(n_{marked}\\) marked smolts. Using these numbers, we can calculate \\(Q\\) and then estimate the total smolt population size \\(N\\).\nWhile we examine the smolts for PIT tags, we also collect some biometric data on their condition.

    "text": "Our paper “Environmental conditions modify density‐dependent salmonid recruitment: Insights into the 2016 recruitment crash in Wales” is out today in Freshwater Biology!\nGregory, S.D., Bewes, V.E., Davey, A.J.H., Roberts, D.E., Gough, P., Davidson, I.C. (2020) Environmental conditions modify density-dependent salmonid recruitment: Insights into the 2016 recruitment crash in Wales. Freshwater Biology, 65: 2135–2153. https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13609\nIn it, we explore whether the apparent juvenile salmon recruitment crash of 2015 was indeed “a crash”, i.e., unprecedented in recent times, and what might have caused it. We conclude that it was a recruitment crash for age 0+ juvenile salmon - but not trout - and that it seemed to be related to high over-winter temperatures, which likely interrupted spawning behaviour or affected egg survival - see figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding the effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors on recruitment is often inhibited by difficulties quantifying their relative contributions in highly variable recruitment data. Use of data-driven statistical methods with data that include one or more extreme recruitment events could help overcome these difficulties.\nJuvenile Atlantic salmon and trout abundances in Wales have declined over the last 2 decades, and 2016 was a notably poor recruitment year in rivers around southern Europe, including England and Wales. The 2016 recruitment crash coincided with extreme winter weather conditions, leading to speculation that unusually warm temperatures and high flows adversely affect salmonid recruitment and caused the 2016 crash, although this remains untested.\nWe developed data-driven statistical models to: (1) describe juvenile salmonid recruitment from density-dependent and density-independent factors; and (2) assess whether the density-independent factors probably contributed to the 2016 salmon recruitment crash. We compiled salmon and trout young-of-year juvenile abundances from electrofishing surveys, egg deposition estimates and river flow and air temperature data from 2001–2017 for seven Welsh rivers, broadly representative of rivers around Wales. We used river flow and air temperature data to derive ecologically and behaviourally meaningful density-independent explanatory variables.\nSalmonid recruitment in Wales was best described using density-dependent and density-independent factors, especially for salmon: after accounting for a concave relationship with egg deposition, salmon juvenile abundance was reduced under (1) warmer spawning temperatures that might inhibit spawning, and (2) higher flood frequencies during pre-emergence and emergence that might washout eggs or alevins. Results were less clear for trout, perhaps because they are behaviourally more plastic.\nOur findings provide empirical support for general and predictable effects of temperature and flow during spawning and emergence on salmonid—especially salmon—recruitment in Wales. Furthermore, we suggest that the 2016 salmon recruitment crash was caused—in part—by particularly inclement spawning and emergence conditions, which could be more common under future climate change. Our findings suggest that future salmonid stock assessment models could include the effects of density-independent variables on recruitment to improve their predictive power.\n\nA pdf reprint is available here: Gregory2020.pdf\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{d.gregory2020,\n  author = {Stephen D.
